 Step 1: Requirement Gathering
Our first task was to understand the project's objectives. We aimed to answer questions about IPL, such as finding 
Title Winners, Orange Cap Winners, Purple Cap Winners, and statistics like Tournament 6's and 4's for each season.

Step 2: Data Import from PostgreSQL
We connected Power BI to our PostgreSQL database to retrieve the necessary IPL data. 
This step ensured that we had the raw data needed for analysis.

Step 3: Connecting Power BI to Database
The seamless connection between Power BI and our database allowed us to access real-time data for our analysis.

Step 4: Data Cleaning
Data cleanliness is key! Using Power Query, we cleaned and transformed the data to remove inconsistencies and ensure 
accuracy in our analysis.

Step 5: Data Processing
With clean data in hand, we performed data processing tasks to prepare it for modeling and analysis.

Step 6: Data Modeling
We created a robust data model with three tables to facilitate efficient analysis. This step was crucial for generating meaningful insights.

Step 7: Time Intelligence Function
Time is of the essence in IPL analysis! We used Time Intelligence functions to track and analyze trends over different seasons, 
creating KPIs to evaluate performance.

Step 8: Data Visualization
The magic of Power BI comes alive in this step! We created visually appealing charts and graphs to represent the data effectively.

Step 9: Generating Insights
The heart of the project! We used DAX queries and various DAX functions like Calculate, Sum, Sumx, Filter, and more to generate 
actionable insights from our charts.

Step 10: Exporting the Report
Last but not least, we compiled all our hard work into a comprehensive IPL Dashboard. Users can now explore IPL Batting and
Bowling stats and even filter by their favorite bowler.

This project has been an incredible learning experience, allowing me to master Power BI functionalities such as data connection,
modeling, cleaning, and DAX queries. We've successfully transformed data into insights, providing a valuable tool for IPL 
enthusiasts and analysts alike.
